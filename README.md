# UFO

Purpose:
	The purpose of this assignment is to make a database more functional and easier to us in terms of parsing the data and finding correlations within the big data set.  

Results:
	This new webpage would be used to determine if there are any patterns about UFO siting in certain cities, states or dates.  Also searching for type of encounter to easily determine if the encounter is a crop circle vs a light in the sky.  Overall, this is a big topic since the military releasing their encounters with UFOs from pilots and military operations.

In conclusion:
	The main drawback is there is not a search for every criterion within the table including the size of the encounter because I know I would like to see which is the biggest encounter.  A couple recommendations would be to improve the appearance of the search criteria and putting in a button so people can add the search criteria they want and then hit the search button to improve overall efficiency of the chart.
